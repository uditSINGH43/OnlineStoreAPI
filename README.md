## About This Project

This repository contains my practice work for API testing using **Postman**.  
Iâ€™m still learning and improving my skills in:
- Writing automated test scripts in Postman  
- Organizing collections, environments, and variables  
- Running test suites and analyzing results  

The idea is to document my learning process while also building something reusable and professional.

## API Testing with Postman

This project includes comprehensive API testing for the Online Store API using **Postman**.  
All collections, environments, test runs, and workspace data are stored in this repository for transparency and reusability.  

Postman files are available in the `postman/` folder.
